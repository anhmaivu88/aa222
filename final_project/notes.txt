Prototype AM Optimization code
- L1 maximization appears to work as intended
- The process seems to (approximately) recover the expected bases, just as in the nullspace formulation!
    - But only when I include all the basis functions  (not just the linear ones), even for the ridge function -- this is very strange!

L1 Maximization works, but does not have the intended effect
- Basically throws all the manifolds together; we'd like to be able to separate them
- Modified code to do progressive re-parameterization 
    - Force all subsequent vectors to be orthogonal to the previous ones
    - Done via a QR decomposition on A = [w_1,...,w_k,e_1,...,e_n],
      where w_i are the previous vectors, and the e_i are the standard
      basis

Code seems to work well, but there are some issues
- Sometimes, the solver will fail to find the global minimum

Possible failure modes:
- Solver is getting stuck in a local min (I think this is the case)
    - Check the gradient at the solver output -- this should tell if the solver
      thinks it is a local min
- Some data sets generate a problem with a very poor solution
    - I find this unlikely, as each test case has an exact solution;
      it is always possible to make the residual identically zero
