Proposal outline

Problem:
- Active Subspaces 
	- Linear subspaces used to parameterize a function with fewer variables than its domain dimensionality
	- Used for Dimension Reduction
	- Don't always exist!
- Active Manifolds
	- Possibility to perform Dimension Reduction on functions which do not admit an Active Subspace
	- A possible way to find AM is to solve a nonlinear optimization problem

Approach:
- Possible formulation of AM
	- Attempt to solve the characteristic equation W^T \nabla f = 0
	- Make computationally tractable by considering a trial basis, controlled by alpha
		- Build a matrix of gradient samples F and trial basis functions M
		- If an exact AM is possible, then M^T F = 0
		- If an exact AM is not possible, then we seek to minimize \|M^T F\|
		- Want alpha to be as dense as possible -- want many manifolds along which f is constant!
	- Challenges: 
		- Non-convex, non-linear optimization problem
		- Possibly the wrong problem statement!
	- This project will focus on solving the optimization problem; there is a further problem of using the information gained to parameterize the function
- Interior point method
	- I already have a method based on quasi-Newton method
	- I may use SciPy's unconstrained minimization routine instead -- it's better tuned than mine
	- Under the current formulation, I only need inequality constraints

Measuring Success:
- Our objective is to find a 'good' basis for parameterizing f
- With this scheme, choosing a linear basis for phi recovers Active Subspaces; at the very least, the optimization process should recover Active Subspace results when provided with this basis
	- If I can recover Active Subspaces, then the procedure finds the 'right' basis for a known case -- this will prove bare-minimum functionality
		- On Ridge Functions, we can find an exact Active Subspace -- we should be able to solve this problem exactly
		- On non-Ridge Functions, we can get an approximate Active Subspace -- compare with C formulation
	- It's possible that the current formulation will not recover AS; in this case I'll need to tune the problem statement until it does
- Once I have minimal functionality, I'll move on to seeking Active Manifolds
	- If we can obtain a smaller error or a smaller dimensionality of alpha than the Active Subspace case, then we've found something novel!
